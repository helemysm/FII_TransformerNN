# Exoplanet Transit Candidate Identification in TESS Full-Frame Images via a Transformer-Based Algorithm

Transformer-based model with a convolutional (CNN) input embedding designed for identifying exoplanet candidates. This approach processes light curve data from missions like TESS. The method combines the attention mechanisms and convolutional feature extraction.

The main module is in the `encoder_model.py` file, which contains the modules needed to build each encoder. Each encoder works with the `EncoderBlock`  class.
